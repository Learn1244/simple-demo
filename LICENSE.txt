Apache HTTP Server (commonly referred to as Apache) is an open-source web server software that allows websites to be served over the internet. It operates using the Apache 2.0 license, which is a permissive open-source license that allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute the software with minimal restrictions.

How Apache Works
Apache functions as a web server by handling HTTP requests and serving web pages to users. Here's a breakdown of how it operates:

1. Client Requests a Webpage
A user enters a website URL (e.g., http://example.com) in their browser.
The browser sends an HTTP request to the Apache web server hosting that website.
2. Apache Processes the Request
Apache listens on port 80 (for HTTP) and port 443 (for HTTPS).
It uses modules (like mod_rewrite for URL handling and mod_ssl for SSL encryption) to process the request.
Apache determines how to handle the request based on configuration files (httpd.conf, .htaccess, or apache2.conf).
3. Apache Retrieves or Generates the Response
If the request is for a static file (e.g., HTML, CSS, images), Apache fetches it from the file system.
If the request is for a dynamic page (e.g., PHP, Python, or Perl scripts), Apache passes it to the appropriate processor (such as mod_php for PHP or mod_wsgi for Python).
4. Apache Sends the Response to the Client
The processed data (HTML, JSON, images, etc.) is sent back to the userâ€™s browser.
The browser renders the response, displaying the requested webpage.
Key Features of Apache
Modular Design: Supports extensions like mod_ssl (for HTTPS), mod_rewrite (for URL rewriting), and more.
Virtual Hosts: Hosts multiple websites on the same server.
Security Features: Supports SSL/TLS encryption and authentication mechanisms.
Reverse Proxy Support: Can act as a reverse proxy for load balancing.
